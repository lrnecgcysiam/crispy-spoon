Publishing a book on platforms like Amazon and Google Play is a great way to share your work with a broad audience. Here's a recommended course of action for self-publishing your next book:

1. **Write and Edit Your Manuscript:** First, write your book, ensuring it's well-edited and proofread. You may want to consider hiring a professional editor or proofreader to ensure the highest quality.

2. **Create an Eye-catching Cover:** A compelling book cover is essential. If you're not a graphic designer, consider hiring one to create an appealing cover that stands out.

3. **Formatting:** Format your manuscript for eBook publication. You can use tools like Kindle Create for Amazon Kindle books. Ensure it looks good on various devices.

4. **ISBN:** You'll need an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) to publish on Google Play, but it's not required for Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). You can purchase an ISBN or use the free ISBN provided by KDP if you plan to publish only on Amazon.

5. **Publish on Amazon KDP:**
   - Sign up for an Amazon KDP account.
   - Create a new Kindle eBook.
   - Upload your manuscript and cover.
   - Set the price, choose your distribution options, and enroll in Kindle Select if desired (this provides some marketing benefits).
   - Publish your eBook.

6. **Publish on Google Play:**
   - Sign up for a Google Play Books Partner account.
   - Add a new book.
   - Fill in the book's details, upload the manuscript, and cover.
   - Set the price and configure distribution options.
   - Publish your eBook.

7. **Marketing:** Develop a marketing plan. Consider using Amazon KDP Select to access promotional tools on Amazon. Promote your book through social media, your website, and book promotion websites. Paid advertising on platforms like Amazon and Google can be effective.

8. **Paperback Version:** If you want to offer a paperback version, you can use Amazon's KDP Print service for Amazon distribution and consider services like IngramSpark for broader distribution.

9. **Collect Reviews:** Encourage readers to leave reviews on Amazon and Google Play. Positive reviews can significantly boost your book's visibility.

10. **Monitor Sales and Adjust:** Keep an eye on your book's sales and adjust your marketing efforts as needed. Consider offering limited-time discounts or free promotions to boost visibility.

11. **Expand Distribution:** You might also explore other eBook platforms like Apple Books, Nook, and Kobo, depending on your target audience.

Remember that self-publishing is a journey, and it may take time to gain traction. Building an audience and refining your marketing strategy can be an ongoing process. Additionally, consider seeking the assistance of a professional book marketer or using online courses and resources to enhance your self-publishing knowledge and skills. Good luck with your next book!
